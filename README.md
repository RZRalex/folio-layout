# folio-layout
a portfolio layout to test classic html pages


This is a single-page project developed in the Coding Dojo class to check html and css proficiency. 
The work has a certain "classic internet" style of the Web 2.0 era. The content and experience shown 
within is quite strong for the format and style that it's on. this was a good attempt to recreate 
the webpage and it took quite a few lines for all this content.
